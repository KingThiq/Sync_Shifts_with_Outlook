This flow checks "Shifts" and creates events in Outlook/Teams Calendar to reflect schedule. This then can be easily synced to a number of other online calendar services! Configured for use by Five-Star A/V Employees at Montage Deer Valley. Flow is universal, so should work for anybody who runs it with correct permissions. If you would like to set this up for your team, give me a holler! Contact info in Publisher Description. 

Connections and Uses: 

-Office365 Users: Used to determine your user ID and name so it can be passed into other functions. UserID is used to get calendars belonging to you and know which teams you're a part of. Name is used to filter shifts, so you don't have EVERYBODY's shift(s) on your calendar. 

-Office365 Outlook: Used to get calendar details and create events in "Calendar". If name is changed, you will need to edit the flow. See flow notes for details. 

-Shifts for Microsoft Teams: Used to request assigned shift info All connections Inputs/Outputs are encrypted by default.
